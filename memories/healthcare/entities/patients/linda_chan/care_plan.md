# Personalized Care Plan

Linda Chan, a 58-year-old female with a diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer, presents a complex case due to her comorbidities, including diabetes and hypertension. The overall goals of her integrated care plan are to effectively manage her cancer treatment while controlling her blood sugar and blood pressure levels, promoting a healthier lifestyle, and ensuring regular monitoring of her health parameters. This multifaceted approach aims to improve her quality of life and enhance treatment outcomes.

| Medical Therapy     | Continue treatment with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and pembrolizumab as prescribed. Regularly evaluate effectiveness and side effects. |
| Lifestyle           | Encourage a balanced diet low in sugar and saturated fats. Promote physical activity as tolerated. Support smoking cessation efforts. |
| Monitoring          | Schedule regular blood pressure and blood glucose checks. Monitor cholesterol levels periodically. Follow up with oncology for cancer treatment responses. |
