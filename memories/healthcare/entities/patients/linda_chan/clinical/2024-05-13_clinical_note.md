# Clinical Encounter — 2024-05-13

**Subjective:**  
Linda Chan, a 58-year-old female with a history of triple-negative breast cancer, presented for her follow-up visit focused on fatigue management. She reports persistent fatigue over the past several weeks, stating that it significantly impacts her daily activities and quality of life. Linda describes her energy levels as "low" and mentions difficulty in completing household tasks and engaging in social activities. She denies any new pain, shortness of breath, or other acute symptoms but expresses concern about the fatigue affecting her overall well-being. 

**Objective:**  
During the examination, Linda exhibited a BMI of 28.4, placing her in the high-risk category for various comorbidities. Vital signs indicated slightly elevated blood pressure at 138/86 mmHg, and her cholesterol level was recorded at 212 mg/dL. No significant abnormalities were noted upon physical examination, although she appeared tired and was less engaged than in previous visits. Current medications include paclitaxel, carboplatin, and pembrolizumab, all part of her ongoing cancer treatment regimen. Laboratory results from recent blood tests showed stable hemoglobin levels, indicating no immediate concerns for anemia, which could contribute to her fatigue.

**Assessment:**  
Linda’s fatigue is likely multifactorial, considering her ongoing cancer treatment and existing comorbidities, including diabetes and hypertension. Psychological factors, such as anxiety or depression related to her cancer diagnosis, may also play a role in her reported fatigue. Given her history of smoking, even as a former smoker, lung function could also be a contributing factor, although no respiratory symptoms were noted at this time.

**Plan:**  
To address Linda's fatigue, we will implement a multifaceted management plan. First, we will refer her to a nutritionist for dietary counseling to optimize her energy levels and overall health. We will also consider initiating a light exercise program, tailored to her abilities, to help improve her physical stamina. Additionally, a mental health evaluation is recommended to assess for any underlying anxiety or depression that may be exacerbating her fatigue. We will schedule a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks to monitor her progress and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.

In summary, Linda's fatigue management will include nutritional support, a tailored exercise regimen, and a mental health assessment. We will continue to monitor her blood pressure and cholesterol levels closely during her treatment. The next follow-up visit is scheduled for 2024-07-08, where we will reassess her fatigue and overall health status.
