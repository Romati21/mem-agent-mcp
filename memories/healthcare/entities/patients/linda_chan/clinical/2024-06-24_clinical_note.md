# Clinical Encounter â€” 2024-06-24

**Subjective:**  
Linda Chan, a 58-year-old female with a history of triple-negative breast cancer, presented for her scheduled follow-up visit on June 24, 2024. She reported persistent fatigue that has been impacting her daily activities and quality of life. Linda described her fatigue as a constant feeling of exhaustion that does not improve with rest. She noted that this fatigue has worsened since her last chemotherapy cycle. Additionally, she expressed concern regarding her ability to manage her diabetes and hypertension alongside the side effects of her current treatment regimen, which includes paclitaxel, carboplatin, and pembrolizumab.

**Objective:**  
On examination, Linda appeared tired but was in no acute distress. Her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure measured at 138/86 mmHg, which remains slightly elevated, and her BMI is recorded at 28.4, placing her in the overweight category. A review of her lab results showed a cholesterol level of 212 mg/dL, which is above the recommended threshold. No new imaging was performed during this visit, as her last imaging study was conducted in May 2024, which showed no evidence of progression of her breast cancer. 

**Assessment:**  
Linda's fatigue appears to be multifactorial, likely stemming from her chemotherapy regimen, along with possible contributions from her underlying conditions, including diabetes and hypertension. The elevated cholesterol level may also be impacting her overall health and energy levels. Given her high-risk status due to her cancer and comorbidities, it is crucial to address these issues holistically. 

**Plan:**  
1. **Fatigue Management:** Discussed strategies for fatigue management, including the implementation of a balanced diet, regular, gentle exercise, and sleep hygiene practices. A referral to a nutritionist was provided to assist Linda in developing a meal plan that accommodates her diabetes and cholesterol levels.
   
2. **Medication Review:** I will review her current medication regimen to evaluate the need for any adjustments, particularly concerning her antihypertensive medications. Consideration of a medication to help manage her cholesterol levels will also be addressed.

3. **Follow-up Labs:** Schedule follow-up lab tests to monitor her blood glucose levels, lipid profile, and complete blood count prior to her next chemotherapy cycle. 

4. **Next Visit:** Linda is advised to return for follow-up in 4 weeks or sooner if her symptoms worsen. During this visit, we will reassess her fatigue, review her lab results, and make necessary adjustments to her treatment plan.

**Closing:**  
In summary, Linda's visit focused on managing her fatigue while considering her comorbid conditions. The next steps include dietary adjustments, medication review, and follow-up lab tests. She will return for follow-up in 4 weeks to evaluate her progress and adapt her treatment plan as needed.
