### Trends and Next Investigations
Malik's blood pressure remains elevated, indicating that his resistant hypertension needs close monitoring and possibly further adjustment of his medication regimen. The cholesterol level is slightly above the recommended threshold, suggesting a need for dietary changes or consideration of cholesterol-lowering medications. Future visits should include a lipid panel and possibly an assessment for vitamin D levels if symptoms occur. Regular follow-ups are essential to evaluate the effectiveness of current medications and lifestyle modifications.
