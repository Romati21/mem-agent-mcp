# Personalized Care Plan

The overall goal for Malik Abiola is to effectively manage his resistant hypertension while minimizing cardiovascular risks and improving his overall health. This involves optimizing his medication regimen, encouraging lifestyle changes, and ensuring regular monitoring of his blood pressure and cholesterol levels. By focusing on these areas, we aim to lower his blood pressure to target levels and enhance his quality of life.

| Focus              | Actions                                             |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Medical Therapy**| - Continue chlorthalidone and spironolactone as prescribed. <br> - Schedule follow-up to assess medication efficacy and side effects. |
| **Lifestyle**      | - Encourage a heart-healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. <br> - Promote regular physical activity (at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise weekly). <br> - Recommend weight management strategies to achieve a BMI below 25. |
| **Monitoring**     | - Monitor blood pressure at home daily and log results. <br> - Schedule cholesterol re-evaluation at the next visit. <br> - Arrange for regular follow-ups every 3 months or sooner if symptoms arise. |

In between visits, Malik should be vigilant about any changes in his health, particularly any new symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, or chest pain. He should also monitor his blood pressure regularly and report any readings consistently above 140/90 mmHg to his healthcare provider. Additionally, he should maintain a record of any side effects from medications and lifestyle changes to discuss during his next appointment.
