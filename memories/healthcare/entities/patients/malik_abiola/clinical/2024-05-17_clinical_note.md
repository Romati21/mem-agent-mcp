**Subjective:**  
Mr. Malik Abiola presented for his follow-up visit focused on medication tolerance related to his management of resistant hypertension. He reported experiencing occasional dizziness, particularly upon standing, which he attributes to his current medication regimen. He described his adherence to medications as good but expressed concerns about the side effects, particularly the dizziness, which has been affecting his daily activities. He denied any episodes of chest pain, shortness of breath, or headaches and reported a stable mood with no signs of depression or anxiety.

**Objective:**  
On examination, Mr. Abiola's blood pressure was recorded at 140/90 mmHg, which remains consistent with prior visits, indicating ongoing hypertension despite pharmacological management. His BMI of 27.6 categorizes him as overweight, and he is currently at a medium risk for cardiovascular events. Laboratory results from his last visit show a total cholesterol level of 206 mg/dL, slightly above the recommended threshold. There were no significant abnormalities noted during the physical examination; his heart rate was regular, and no edema was observed in the extremities.

**Assessment:**  
Mr. Abiola continues to present with resistant hypertension, and his symptoms of dizziness may be related to his medications, specifically the diuretic chlorthalidone. Given the elevated cholesterol levels, it is also pertinent to consider his cardiovascular risk profile. His current regimen of chlorthalidone and spironolactone appears to require reassessment to optimize his blood pressure control while minimizing side effects.

**Plan:**  
1. **Medication Adjustment:** We will consider a dose adjustment of chlorthalidone or possibly switching to another antihypertensive agent with a more favorable side effect profile. 
2. **Lifestyle Counseling:** Emphasize dietary modifications aimed at reducing cholesterol, including increased intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while reducing saturated fats and sodium.
3. **Monitoring:** Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to reassess blood pressure and review any changes in symptoms. Additionally, a lipid panel will be ordered to monitor cholesterol levels.
4. **Education:** Discussed the importance of hydration and gradual position changes to mitigate dizziness. Mr. Abiola was encouraged to report any worsening of symptoms or new concerns.

In closing, Mr. Abiola's management plan will focus on optimizing his hypertension treatment while addressing his medication tolerance issues. We will continue to monitor his progress closely and adjust his treatment plan as necessary during the next visit scheduled for June 14, 2024.
