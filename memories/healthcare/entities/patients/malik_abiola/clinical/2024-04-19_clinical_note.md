# Clinical Encounter â€” 2024-04-19

**Patient ID:** HR03110  
**Name:** Malik Abiola  
**Age:** 49  
**Gender:** Male  

During the visit on April 19, 2024, Mr. Malik Abiola presented with concerns primarily related to mobility and gait. He reported experiencing occasional stiffness in his lower extremities, particularly after prolonged periods of inactivity. Mr. Abiola noted that while he is able to perform daily activities, he feels a slight decrease in his mobility, especially when transitioning from sitting to standing. He denied any recent falls or significant pain but expressed a desire to improve his overall mobility to enhance his quality of life.

Upon examination, Mr. Abiola exhibited a stable blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, consistent with his diagnosis of resistant hypertension. His BMI was recorded at 27.6, placing him in the overweight category. Neurological and musculoskeletal assessments were performed, revealing no significant deficits. Gait analysis indicated a mild antalgic gait, which may be contributing to his mobility concerns. Additionally, his cholesterol level was noted at 206, requiring continued monitoring and management.

Laboratory tests performed during the visit were reviewed, and no new abnormalities were identified. His current medication regimen, including chlorthalidone and spironolactone, was confirmed to be appropriate for his hypertension management. The patient was educated on the importance of maintaining an active lifestyle and was encouraged to engage in regular low-impact exercises, such as walking or swimming, to promote mobility and cardiovascular health.

The treatment plan includes a referral to physical therapy for a tailored exercise program aimed at improving strength and flexibility. Mr. Abiola was advised to maintain a daily log of his mobility exercises and any changes in his symptoms to bring to his next appointment. We will also schedule follow-up lab work to monitor his cholesterol levels and overall health.

In conclusion, Mr. Abiola's concerns about mobility and gait have been addressed with a comprehensive plan that includes physical therapy and continued monitoring of his hypertension and cholesterol levels. The next follow-up visit is scheduled for June 14, 2024, where we will reassess his progress and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.
