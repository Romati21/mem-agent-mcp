# Wearable Snapshot — 2024-06-10

## Activity Trends
During the week leading up to June 10, Malik maintained a moderate activity level, logging an average of **6,000 steps per day**. The data indicates a consistent engagement in daily routines, with peaks observed on days when he participated in social activities. Regular physical activity is crucial, especially for managing resistant hypertension, as it helps in maintaining cardiovascular health. 

## Sleep Patterns
Malik's sleep metrics show a steady average of **7 hours of sleep per night**, with periods of restorative deep sleep contributing to overall recovery. However, there were notable fluctuations in sleep quality, particularly on nights following physically demanding days. Prioritizing hydration before bed and maintaining a calming pre-sleep routine could enhance his sleep quality and, consequently, his blood pressure management.

## Notable Alerts
Throughout the week, the wearable device flagged **two hydration alerts**, indicating that Malik fell short of his daily water intake goals. Given the role of hydration in regulating blood pressure, it's essential for him to stay adequately hydrated—especially while on medications like chlorthalidone and spironolactone, which can affect fluid balance. Incorporating more fluids throughout the day could help mitigate potential spikes in blood pressure and support his overall health.
