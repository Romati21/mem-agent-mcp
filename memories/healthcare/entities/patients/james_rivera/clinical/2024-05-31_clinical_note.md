# Clinical Encounter â€” 2024-05-31

**Subjective:**  
James Rivera, a 52-year-old male with a history of metastatic colorectal cancer, presented for his follow-up visit focusing on medication tolerance. He reported experiencing some gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea and mild abdominal discomfort, which he attributed to the FOLFOX regimen. James mentioned that while he understands these effects are common, they have been impacting his appetite and overall energy levels. He also expressed concern about how his diabetes and hypertension might be affecting his cancer treatment.

**Objective:**  
On examination, James appeared well-nourished but slightly fatigued. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure was recorded at 150/92 mmHg, and he had a body mass index (BMI) of 33.5, placing him in the high-risk category for complications. His cholesterol level was noted to be 240 mg/dL, which remains above the recommended level. A review of his medication list confirmed he is currently on the FOLFOX regimen along with bevacizumab. No new masses were palpable, and there were no signs of acute distress during the physical examination.

**Imaging/Lab References:**  
Recent imaging studies, including a CT scan performed on 2024-05-15, indicated stable disease with no new metastatic lesions identified. Laboratory results from his last visit showed mild elevations in liver enzymes, which will be monitored closely. His blood glucose levels have been within target ranges; however, his hypertension remains a concern, and adjustments to his antihypertensive regimen may be necessary if his blood pressure does not improve.

**Plan:**  
To address James's medication tolerance, we will consider supportive measures including antiemetics to alleviate nausea and dietary modifications to improve his appetite. Additionally, a referral to a dietitian will be made to develop a tailored nutrition plan. Regarding his hypertension, we will review his current medications and consider an adjustment to optimize blood pressure control. A follow-up appointment is scheduled for 2024-07-12, at which time we will reassess his response to the adjusted treatment plan and further evaluate his cancer status.

In summary, James will continue with his current cancer treatment regimen while we implement supportive care for his gastrointestinal symptoms and monitor his hypertension more closely. He is encouraged to maintain communication regarding any changes in his symptoms or side effects. We will reconvene in July to evaluate progress and make any additional necessary adjustments.
