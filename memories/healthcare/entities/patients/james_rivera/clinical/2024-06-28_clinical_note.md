# Clinical Encounter â€” 2024-06-28

**Patient Name:** James Rivera  
**Patient ID:** HR02350  
**Age:** 52  
**Gender:** Male  
**Date of Visit:** 2024-06-28  

**Subjective:**  
Mr. Rivera presented for his scheduled follow-up appointment, primarily focusing on care coordination related to his ongoing treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. He expressed concern about his recent fatigue and occasional abdominal discomfort, which he rated as a 4 out of 10 on the pain scale. He reported compliance with his current medication regimen, including the FOLFOX chemotherapy and bevacizumab, but mentioned some challenges with maintaining his dietary habits due to nausea post-chemotherapy. Mr. Rivera is motivated to manage his health actively and is seeking support in optimizing his treatment plan.

**Objective:**  
On examination, Mr. Rivera appeared alert and in no acute distress. Vital signs were recorded as follows: blood pressure 150/92 mmHg, heart rate 80 bpm, and respiratory rate 18 breaths/min. His BMI is noted at 33.5, indicating obesity, which places him in a high-risk category. A review of his recent lab work revealed elevated cholesterol levels at 240 mg/dL and indications of hyperglycemia, consistent with his diabetes diagnosis. No new masses were palpable during the abdominal exam, but mild tenderness was noted in the left upper quadrant.

**Imaging and Labs:**  
Recent imaging studies, including a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis performed on 2024-06-15, showed stable disease with no new lesions identified. However, there was a slight increase in the size of a previously noted liver lesion, warranting continued monitoring. Routine lab results from his last blood draw indicated elevated liver enzymes, which will need to be addressed in conjunction with his oncologist. His hemoglobin levels were within normal limits, suggesting no immediate need for transfusion.

**Plan:**  
The care coordination plan includes a multidisciplinary approach involving oncology, diabetes management, and nutrition counseling. Mr. Rivera will continue with the current FOLFOX regimen and bevacizumab, with the next chemotherapy cycle scheduled for 2024-07-12. We will refer him to a dietitian to address his dietary concerns and help manage his nausea. Additionally, a follow-up appointment with his endocrinologist is recommended to optimize diabetes management and control his cholesterol levels. Mr. Rivera was advised to monitor his blood pressure at home and report any further symptoms of discomfort or significant changes in his health status.

In closing, we will maintain regular communication with all members of Mr. Rivera's healthcare team to ensure cohesive management of his metastatic colorectal cancer and comorbid conditions. A follow-up visit is scheduled in two weeks to assess his response to the adjusted care plan and to address any further concerns.
