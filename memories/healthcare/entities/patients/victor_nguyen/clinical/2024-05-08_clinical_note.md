**Subjective:**  
Victor Nguyen, a 62-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and hypertension, presented for his follow-up visit focusing on mobility and gait. He reports experiencing occasional stiffness in his joints, particularly in the knees and hips, which he attributes to his chronic conditions. Victor also mentions that he feels his balance has declined slightly, especially when walking on uneven surfaces. Despite these concerns, he remains motivated to maintain an active lifestyle and engages in light exercises at home.

**Objective:**  
During the examination, Victor’s vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 144/90 mmHg and a BMI of 28.9, placing him in the high-risk category. His cholesterol level is recorded at 225 mg/dL, which is above the recommended threshold. A physical examination showed decreased range of motion in both knees and mild swelling around the joints. Gait analysis indicated a slight antalgic gait, likely related to discomfort in his lower extremities. Neurological assessment showed intact sensation and reflexes, indicating no immediate neurological deficits.

**Imaging/Lab References:**  
Recent lab results from his last visit on July 10, 2024, indicated stable renal function with an eGFR of 55 mL/min, consistent with his chronic kidney disease stage. His HbA1c was at 7.2%, indicating reasonable control over his diabetes, but with room for improvement. These results warrant continued monitoring and adjustment of his diabetes management plan. Additionally, lipid profiles should be addressed in light of his elevated cholesterol levels.

**Plan:**  
The management plan includes continuing dapagliflozin for diabetes control and lisinopril for hypertension, which are both well-tolerated. A referral to physical therapy is recommended to address his mobility concerns, focusing on strength training and balance exercises tailored to his needs. In addition, dietary counseling will be beneficial to manage cholesterol levels and overall heart health. A follow-up appointment is scheduled for three months to reassess his mobility, blood pressure, and kidney function.

In summary, Victor’s current health status will be closely monitored, with a focus on improving his mobility and managing his chronic conditions effectively. Next steps include initiating physical therapy and dietary modifications, along with regular follow-up to evaluate the efficacy of these interventions.
