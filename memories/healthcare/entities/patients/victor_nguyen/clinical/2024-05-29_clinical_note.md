# Clinical Encounter â€” 2024-05-29

**Subjective:**  
Victor Nguyen, a 62-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and hypertension, returned for a follow-up visit primarily focused on fatigue management. He reports persistent fatigue that has been affecting his daily activities and overall quality of life. Victor describes the fatigue as a constant feeling of tiredness, exacerbated by physical exertion. He also mentions difficulty concentrating, which he attributes to his ongoing tiredness. While he is compliant with his medications, he expresses concern about his energy levels and is eager to explore potential interventions.

**Objective:**  
On examination, Victor appears well-nourished but somewhat fatigued. His vital signs indicate a blood pressure of 144/90 mmHg and a BMI of 28.9, placing him in the high-risk category for cardiovascular complications. A review of his lab results from the last visit, dated 2024-07-10, shows a cholesterol level of 225 mg/dL, which is above the recommended threshold. His renal function tests indicate a steady decline in kidney function, consistent with his diagnosis of chronic kidney disease. There are no acute abnormalities noted on his physical exam, but he does display signs of mild pallor.

**Assessment:**  
Victor's fatigue is likely multifactorial, given his chronic health conditions. Chronic kidney disease can contribute to anemia and energy depletion, while poorly controlled diabetes and hypertension may also play a role. His elevated cholesterol levels are concerning, particularly given his high-risk status. A detailed review of his current medication regimen, which includes dapagliflozin and lisinopril, suggests that while they are appropriate for his conditions, further adjustments may be needed to optimize his overall health and manage fatigue.

**Plan:**  
1. **Medication Review:** Consider adjusting lisinopril dosage to better control blood pressure and explore the possibility of adding an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent to manage potential anemia associated with chronic kidney disease.
2. **Lifestyle Modifications:** Discuss dietary modifications aimed at lowering cholesterol levels, including increasing fiber intake and reducing saturated fats. Recommend a structured physical activity plan tailored to his energy levels.
3. **Follow-Up Testing:** Order repeat laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, renal function panel, and lipid profile, to assess the renal function and cholesterol levels more closely. Schedule these for two weeks from today.
4. **Referral to Specialist:** Recommend a referral to a nephrologist for further evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease, particularly in light of his fatigue.

In closing, Victor will be scheduled for follow-up in two weeks to review lab results and assess the effectiveness of any new interventions. He is encouraged to keep a diary of his fatigue levels and any changes in his symptoms, which will aid in further management.
