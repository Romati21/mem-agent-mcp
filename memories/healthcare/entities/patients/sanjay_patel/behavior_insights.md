Sanjay Patel is a 46-year-old male managing Type 2 diabetes. With a BMI of 31.2, he falls into the medium risk category, which prompts a closer look at his lifestyle and support systems. 

### Routines
Sanjay's daily routine includes regular meal times, but he often struggles with portion control. He has started incorporating more vegetables into his diet, thanks to some recent education on balanced eating. However, he still finds it challenging to resist high-carb snacks, especially in the evenings.
