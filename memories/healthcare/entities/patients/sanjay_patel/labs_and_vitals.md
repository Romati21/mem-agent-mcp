### Trends and Next Investigations

Sanjay's blood pressure remains stable, and his cholesterol level is within the desirable range. However, with a BMI of 31.2, he is categorized as obese, which may complicate diabetes management. It is crucial to monitor his A1c levels in the upcoming visits to assess glycemic control. Additionally, a vitamin D level check and kidney function tests (eGFR) are recommended to ensure comprehensive management of his diabetes. Regular follow-ups will be essential to evaluate progress and adjust treatment as needed.
