**Subjective:**  
Mr. Sanjay Patel, a 46-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes, presented for his scheduled visit on May 2, 2024. He reported experiencing increased fatigue over the past month, which he described as persistent and interfering with his daily activities. Mr. Patel noted that his energy levels have significantly declined, making it challenging to maintain his regular exercise routine. He expressed concern about how this could affect his diabetes management. He denied any new stressors or changes in his daily routine and reported adherence to his current medication regimen, which includes metformin and semaglutide.

**Examination:**  
On examination, Mr. Patel appeared well-nourished but slightly fatigued. His vital signs included a blood pressure reading of 132/82 mmHg and a heart rate of 74 bpm. His weight was stable, and his BMI of 31.2 categorizes him as overweight. A thorough physical examination revealed no acute distress, and there were no signs of dehydration or other complications related to his diabetes. His cholesterol level was noted to be 185 mg/dL, which remains within acceptable limits. 

**Labs and Imaging:**  
Laboratory results from the most recent tests indicated that Mr. Patel’s HbA1c was 7.2%, suggesting reasonable control of his diabetes. Kidney function tests were normal, and there were no indications of microvascular complications at this time. Given the patient’s current symptoms of fatigue, we discussed the potential need for further evaluation, including comprehensive metabolic panels to rule out any underlying causes such as thyroid dysfunction or anemia.

**Plan:**  
The plan moving forward includes addressing Mr. Patel's fatigue. We discussed the importance of maintaining a balanced diet and optimizing his physical activity within his comfort level. I recommended he engage in light exercise, such as walking, and consider a referral to a dietitian for personalized nutritional advice. Additionally, we will schedule a follow-up lab test in two weeks to monitor his glucose levels and assess for any contributing factors to his fatigue. If symptoms persist, we may consider adjusting his diabetes medications or further testing.

In closing, we will reconvene for a follow-up appointment on June 20, 2024, to review his lab results and reassess his energy levels. Mr. Patel was encouraged to maintain a daily log of his symptoms and lifestyle habits, which will aid in our next discussion. He was also reminded to reach out if he experiences any new or worsening symptoms before our next visit.
