**Subjective:**  
Sanjay Patel, a 46-year-old male with a history of Type 2 diabetes, presents for a routine follow-up visit focused on care coordination. He reports feeling generally well, with no acute complaints. However, he expresses concern about maintaining stable blood glucose levels given his recent dietary changes. Sanjay mentions he has been trying to incorporate more whole foods into his diet but occasionally struggles with cravings for high-sugar snacks. He denies any episodes of hypoglycemia and is committed to his medication regimen, which includes metformin and semaglutide.

**Examination Details:**  
On examination, Sanjay is alert and in no acute distress. His vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 132/82 mmHg, which is within the normal range for his age. His current weight shows a BMI of 31.2, placing him in the overweight category. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable, and lung sounds are clear upon auscultation. His cholesterol level is recorded at 185 mg/dL, which is acceptable, given his overall health profile. Foot examination reveals no lesions or neuropathy, and his last hemoglobin A1c was 7.2%, indicating reasonable glycemic control.

**Lab and Imaging References:**  
Recent labs indicate that Sanjay's fasting glucose levels are within the target range, reinforcing his adherence to the prescribed medication regimen. His lipid panel remains stable, keeping his cholesterol levels under control. As part of routine monitoring, we will continue to assess his A1c levels every three months, and he is encouraged to track his daily blood glucose readings to facilitate ongoing management.

**Plan:**  
To enhance care coordination, a referral to a nutritionist will be made to aid Sanjay in achieving his dietary goals. We will also schedule regular follow-up visits every three months to monitor his diabetes management closely. Additionally, I will provide resources for diabetes education and support groups, which may prove beneficial in managing his condition and lifestyle changes.

**Next Steps:**  
Sanjay is to return for his next appointment on 2024-06-20. In the meantime, he is encouraged to maintain his medication adherence, continue monitoring his blood glucose levels, and reach out with any concerns. We will reconvene to evaluate the effectiveness of dietary changes and make adjustments as necessary.
