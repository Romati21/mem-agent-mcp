# Redaction Protocol

When filters request privacy:
- remove: identifiers (name, patient_id, dates of birth, addresses)
- mask: genomic markers, trial IDs, and contact info
- generalize: visit dates to month/year when sharing externally
- summarize: wearable metrics as ranges instead of exact values
