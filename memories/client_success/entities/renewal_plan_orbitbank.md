# Renewal Plan: OrbitBank Financial Services (2026-02-15)

## Overview
- **ARR**: $610,000 (transformation play type)
- **Sponsor**: Malik Okafor (Chief Digital Officer)
- **Current Health Status**: Neutral (data latency concerns impacting usage at 62% active seats)
- **Key Risk**: Data synchronization delays affecting compliance and reporting

## Renewal Timeline (Aligned with Transformation Play)

| Phase | Trigger | Actions | Responsible Party |
|-------|---------|---------|------------------|
| **t_minus_120** | Renewal trigger in HubSpot | Assign dedicated renewal owner | Client Success Team |
| **t_minus_90** | Value recap | Present NRR justification deck (CFO review) | Finance Team |
| **t_minus_60** | Pricing package finalization | Secure CFO approval for transformation play | Finance & Strategy |
| **t_minus_45** | Procurement submission | Submit order form to procurement team | Operations |
| **t_minus-30** | Executive sign-off | Finalize renewal with executive sponsor | Client Success Team |

## Risk Mitigation Strategies
1. **Data Latency Crisis** (currently SEV-2):
   - Daily latency reports from Engineering until resolved
   - Bi-weekly executive touchpoints with Maya Chen (as per existing mitigation)
   - Immediate escalation to Security team for DPA compliance checks
2. **Compliance Risks** (legal requests):
   - Legal updates DPA with every scope change
   - Security team involved in all compliance-related changes (as noted)
3. **CFO Targeting**:
   - NRR justification deck delivered 60 days before renewal (as required)
   - Scenario modeling for potential NRR impacts (compliance vs. revenue)

## Required Approvals
| Approval Type | Threshold | Responsible Party | Timeline |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| **CFO Sign-off** | NRR justification complete | Chief Financial Officer | t_minus_60 |
| **Legal Sign-off** | DPA updates completed | Legal Department | t_minus_45 |
| **Security Sign-off** | Compliance with DPA | Security Team | Real-time (for incidents) |
